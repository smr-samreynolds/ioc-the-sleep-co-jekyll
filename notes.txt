- We want to jekyll-ify the head, header and footer.
- We'll create a layout template that includes all the stuff that gets repeated and then adapt it for each page.

- The header changes slightly from page to page - the text, the subtitle and the banner image height.
    - There are two ways to go about this.

- The "_site" folder is where jekyll will output.
- Create an "_layouts" folder and inside create a "default.html" file, this is the code used to load every single page.

- Looking at the "index.html" go through and figure out which parts we want to have on every single page.
    - viewport meta
    - title
    - font awesome
    - gridlex
    - google gonts
    - stylesheet
    - closing </head> tag
    - open <body> tag
- copy from the !DOCTYPE to the open <body> tag, paste it into the "default.html" and then delete it from the "index.html"

- Scroll down in the "index.html" and find the first part that is repeated which is the footer. Simply put, whatever you want to appear on every single page should be moved to the "default.html"

- Tackling the header
    - Figure out which parts stay the same and which parts changes
    - For the parts that stay the same we can create an "include".
        - create a new folder called "_includes"
        - create a new html file/include for the header and name it something that relates to the code inside e.g. "header-nav.html"
        - go back to the header and take the part that is consitent, the part that will be used again and again and paste it into the include (header-nav.html) and delete it from the index.
        In its place add liquid text {% include header-nav.html%} - this tells the browser to pull in the header nav and paste it in this place.

*** REGULARLY SUBMIT TO GITHUB ***   
*** It can be helpful to have the terminal open all the time as you'll easily be able to see any errors as they're happening. It's only really possible on a bigger/external monitor   

- Now we go through the about page and so the same thing
    - look at/ find the parts we want to cut out.
        - from the <body> tag up and the from the <footer> down we can delete.
    - add in the liquid text for the header-nav.html
    - look carefully at the classes in the header across the index and about pages and make sure they are consistently placed within the same elements. 

- Now onto the "products" and "contact" pages.
 
- Another way to make the header changes is to copy all of the header into the header-nav.html include and then replace each part with a variable.
- Go through the header and decide on which parts will change across different pages.
- Add a variable for each part of the text, with and without the span


- Icon grid on the homepage
- delete three of them
- wrap the remaining one in a for loop

CUSTOM ADDING IMAGES
- in the products page, cards section.
- a way to add custom IMAGES
- find where the images are being added. In this case it is the class "bg-image" usually we we would add an additional class e.g. bg-sheets and then set it up in the css. But this isn't very helpful if your clients want to be able to change the iamge themselves in the CMS
- for 99% of things CSS should be kept in a separate style sheet. Inline CSS can be useful in this case to enable clients to change the images themselves. So we'll hardcode the css into the html jekyll loop using the style attribute, this carries a very high specificity. 

ADDING A HAMBURGER MENU USING jQUERY
- first add the jQuery CDN, google it and then copy the script tag.
- we want to add this to every page so we will add it into the head of the default page just above the closing </body> tag. 
- Make sure to add jQuery first and then any external tools like a pop-up gallery or slick slider. 
- Your own custom javascript should go at the end.
- Go to the header-nav.html include and replace the nav that is alread in there and replace it with a hamburger nav on mobile.
